# Privicy is the best policy
lets see how I protect yours
#### your data will *never* be
1. transmitted over the internet (execept when recieving)
2. shared with other users outside of commands

#### your data *will* be
1. cached to allow faster commands 
	ex: your classes will cached to save on bandwidth
2. displayed upon request from
	a. Server Members with the `manage guild` permissions (limited)
	b. Our [Authorized users](util.js#L15) (limited)
	c. **you** when using commands
	(limited means that they dont get as much data)
